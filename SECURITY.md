## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to report

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.
2. Email the maintainers at the contact address listed in the repository, or use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature.
3. Include a clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and the potential impact.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 48 hours of your report.
- **Assessment** within 5 business days — we will evaluate the severity and determine a fix timeline.
- **Resolution** — critical vulnerabilities will be patched and released as soon as possible; lower-severity issues will be addressed in the next scheduled release.
- **Credit** — reporters will be credited in the changelog unless they request anonymity.

## Security Design Principles

This tool is designed as a **local diagnostic utility** and follows these security practices:

### No secrets in logs

- Request payloads are logged only as **SHA-256 hash prefixes** — never in plaintext.
- API keys are never displayed in console output, reports, or the web dashboard.
- The `FOUNDRY_API_KEY` value (typically `"unused"` for Foundry Local) is redacted from all report output.

### No external network access

- All HTTP requests target **`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`** only — the tool communicates exclusively with the local Foundry Local service.
- No telemetry, analytics, or external API calls are made.
- The SDK's native FFI (`koffi`) interfaces only with locally installed `Microsoft.AI.Foundry.Local.Core.dll`.

### No authentication bypass

- The web dashboard listens on `localhost:3000` by default and is intended for **local development use only**.
- No authentication layer is provided — the dashboard should **not** be exposed to untrusted networks.

### Dependency security

- Dependencies are pinned to major/minor ranges in `package.json`.
- The project uses `npm audit` for vulnerability scanning.
- The `@prathikrao/foundry-local-sdk` depends on `koffi` (native FFI) — ensure you trust the native binary before installation.

### Input validation

- Model identifiers and probe names are validated against known allowlists before execution.
- Request bodies to the web API are parsed with `express.json()` middleware with default size limits.
- No user-supplied input is passed to `execSync` or shell commands — the only shell command is the hardcoded `foundry service status`.

## Scope

This security policy covers the code in this repository. It does **not** cover:

- **Foundry Local** itself (the AI inference service)
- **`@prathikrao/foundry-local-sdk`** (the official SDK — report SDK issues to its maintainers)
- **Model weights or outputs** generated by the AI models
- **Third-party npm packages** (report upstream vulnerabilities to the respective package maintainers)
